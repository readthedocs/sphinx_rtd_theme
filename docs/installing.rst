Installation
============

How to install and use the theme
--------------------------------

Install the ``sphinx_rtd_theme`` package (or add it to your ``requirements.txt`` file):

.. code:: console

    $ pip install sphinx_rtd_theme

In your Sphinx project's ``conf.py`` file, add ``sphinx_rtd_theme`` to the list of enabled extensions and as the active theme:

.. code:: python

    extensions = [
        ...
        'sphinx_rtd_theme',
    ]

    html_theme = "sphinx_rtd_theme"

.. seealso::
    :ref:`supported-browsers`
        Officially supported and tested browser/operating system combinations

    :ref:`supported-dependencies`
        Officially Supported versions of Python, Sphinx, and other dependencies.


.. note::

   Adding this theme as an extension is what enables localization of theme
   strings in your translated output. If these strings are not translated in
   your output, either we lack the localized strings for your locale, or you
   are using an old version of the theme.

   ..
      comment about this note: it's possibly not necessary to add the theme as an extension.
      Rather, this is an issue caused by setting html_theme_path.

.. _howto_upgrade:

How to upgrade
--------------

Adding ``sphinx-rtd-theme`` to your project's dependencies will make pip install the latest compatible version of the theme.

If you want to test a **pre-release**, you need to be explicit about the version you specify.
Otherwise, pip will ignore pre-releases. Add for instance ``sphinx-rtd-theme==1.1.0b3`` to test a pre-release.

.. tip::
    We recommend that you pin the version of Sphinx that your project is built with.
    We won't release sphinx-rtd-theme without marking its compatibility with Sphinx. So if you do not pin ``sphinx-rtd-theme`` itself, you will always get the *latest compatible* release.
    
    More information is available in Read the Docs' documentation on :doc:`rtd:guides/reproducible-builds`.


Via Git or Download
-------------------

.. warning::

   Installing directly from the repository source is deprecated and is not
   recommended. Static assets won't be included in the repository starting in
   release :ref:`roadmap-release-3.0.0`.

Symlink or subtree the ``sphinx_rtd_theme/sphinx_rtd_theme`` repository into your documentation at
``docs/_themes/sphinx_rtd_theme`` then add the following two settings to your Sphinx
``conf.py`` file:

.. code:: python

    html_theme = "sphinx_rtd_theme"
    html_theme_path = ["_themes", ]
